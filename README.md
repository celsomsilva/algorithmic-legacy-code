# Algorithmic Legacy Code (Pascal & C)

This repository contains original academic algorithm implementations written in Pascal and C in the 2000s.

## A Note About the Old Code

Everything inside `legacy_pascal` and `legacy_c` is **pre-StackOverflow, pre-GPT, pre-Google, pre-autocomplete, pre-formatters**.

Back then the workflow was:

* books
* xerox copies
* compilers yelling at you
* indentation done manually
* comments only if the professor demanded


Several files in the legacy directories have:

* variable names in Portuguese
* weird indentation
* multiple versions of the same algorithm (loop, recursion, `goto`…)
* minimal comments

I keep them untouched on purpose — they’re part of the story.

## How the Legacy Folders Work

* **legacy directories** — all original Pascal/C files exactly as they were
* cleaned directories — a small subset of selected files, curated and cleaned for readability.


Purpose:
- historical reference
- context for later reimplementations
- record of early algorithmic training


Modern benchmark and reimplementation projects:
- Algorithmic Benchmark Suite (R): https://github.com/celsomsilva/algorithmic-benchmark-suite-R
- Algorithmic Benchmark Suite (Java): https://github.com/celsomsilva/algorithmic-benchmark-suite-java
- Algorithmic Benchmark Suite (Rust): https://github.com/celsomsilva/algorithmic-benchmark-suite-rust

This keeps **authenticity** and **modern clarity** side by side.
