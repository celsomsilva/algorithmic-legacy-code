  ORIGINAL NAME: ESPIRAL.PAS

  This program draws a spiral using polar coordinates.

  The spiral is generated by gradually increasing the angle
  and converting it from degrees to radians. Each new point
  is calculated using cosine and sine functions and then
  connected to the previous point with a line.

  This is a typical graphics exercise combining:
  - trigonometry
  - incremental drawing
  - coordinate transformations
