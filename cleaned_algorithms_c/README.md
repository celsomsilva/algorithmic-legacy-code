# Cleaned C Algorithms

This directory contains a curated subset of C programs selected from the original academic archive (`legacy_c/`).

Selection criteria:
- Demonstrates classical data structures or algorithms
- Highlights pointer-based reasoning
- Can be mapped to modern implementations (R, Python, etc.)
- Represents increasing algorithmic complexity

Each file:
- Was renamed to an English, descriptive name
- Contains a header comment referencing the original filename
- Preserves the original algorithmic logic
